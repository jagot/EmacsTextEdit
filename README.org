#+TITLE: Emacsclient handler for textedit:// URIs
#+AUTHOR: Stefanos Carlstr√∂m
#+EMAIL: stefanos.carlstrom@gmail.com

This simple AppleScript application links =textedit://= URIs to
Emacsclient, such that clicking a =textedit://= automatically opens
the corresponding file at the correct location in the already running
Emacs instance. This is useful for e.g. Lilypond files.

* Installation instructions
  Simply typing
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    make install
  #+END_SRC
  in the root folder will compile the AppleScript application bundle
  and install it into your personal =~/Applications/= folder. To
  uninstall it, simply delete =~/Applications/EmacsTextEdit.app=.
